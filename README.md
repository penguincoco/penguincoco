I'm a multidisciplinary developer passionate about making tiny games! 
I come from an engineering background and have 5 years of experience developing games in Unity, and have recently pivoted into technical production.

I love exploring how games can bring people together and be used to foster a sense of connection. 

I love hiking and frolicking in fields of wildflowers, reading, and trying out new foods (I also do a variety of funny accents)
